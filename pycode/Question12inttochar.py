# Q12 Accept an integer (between 65 and 90), print its equivalent character (No need of loops or conditional statements)
# NOTE: Any user input in 3.x versions are treated as strings. So input string and convert to required data type (in our case, it is int)

a = input("Accept an integer between 65 and 90")
print(chr(int(a)))
# print(unichr(int(a))) = in python2
